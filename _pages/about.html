            <p>Webstoemp is the portfolio and blog of Jérôme Coupé, a designer and front-end developer from Brussels, Belgium.</p>
          </div>
          <p>I am primarily a front-end developer with an interest in design systems, pattern libraries and UX. I have been writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and creating websites for the last {{ "now" | date: "%Y" | minus: 1996 }} years. <a href="/contact/">Get in touch</a> if you're interested in working with me.</p>
          <p>I also teach front-end technologies and web project management at the Institut des Arts de Diffusion (IAD) in Louvain-La-Neuve. Outside of school, I sometimes conduct workshops on CMS solutions, responsive web design or prototyping in the browser.</p>
          <p>When I am not busy designing and coding up a website or teaching, chances are I am drinking a nice Belgian beer with friends somewhere in Brussels.</p>
